# What is Bone.io?

Bone.io is a VIO framework for building high performance, highly scalable single page HTML5 apps.

What does VIO mean?

* View   - HTML5 Document 
* Input  - Data entering the browser or server.
* Output - Data leaving the browser or server.

### Browser Support

#### Desktop

* Internet Explorer 6+
* Safari 3+
* Google Chrome 4+
* Firefox 3+
* Opera 10.61+

#### Mobile

* iPhone Safari
* iPad Safari
* Android WebKit
* WebOs WebKit


# Getting Started

### In the Browser

To install the browser library, just include "bone.io.js" and the two dependencies in your html:

```html
<script src="/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script src="/bone.io.js"></script>
```

Bone.io depends on jquery for DOM manipulation, and socket.io for realtime websockets.

Here are a list of the browser components:

* [View](https://github.com/techpines/bone.io#view) - A view is based on a CSS selector and handles DOM events and DOM manipulations.
* [IO](https://github.com/techpines/bone.io#io-inputoutput) - Input/Output handles bi-directional data communication with various endpoints.
* [Router](https://github.com/techpines/bone.io#router) - A router executes routes based on client side url changes.
* [Templates](https://github.com/techpines/bone.io#templates) - Use any templating system you like and plug into the bone.io templating infrastructure.

### On the Server

You can install the library with npm:

```bash
npm install bone.io
```

On the server you can just require it:

```js
var bone = require('bone.io');
```

Currently, the only server side component is for IO:

* [IO](http://bone.io) - Input/Output handles bi-directional data communication with connected devices.

## View

![bone.io](http://cdn.techpines.io/bone.io-view-architecture-github.png)

A view in bone.io is based on a `selector`.  They take care of DOM events and changes.

```js
bone.view.DataRow = bone.view('tr.data-row', {

    events: {
        'click .icon': 'open',
        'click .button.edit': 'edit',
        'click .button.delete': 'remove'
    },

    remove: function(event) {
        this.$el.remove();
    },

    edit: function(data) {
        ...
    }

});
```

Similar to backbone.js, views have a few handy properties attached to `this`:

* `this.el` - The dom element for the current action.
* `this.$el` - The jquery element for the current action.
* `this.$` - Short hand for `this.$el.find`, because scoping is good.
* `this.data` - Store and retrieve data on the element shortcut for `$this.$el.data`.

# IO (Input/Output)

IO modules have the same api in both the browser and node.  The following diagram shows the architecture that bone.io is trying to replicate.

![bone.io](http://cdn.techpines.io/bone.io-io-architecture-github.png)

### In the Abstract

Abstractly, each individual IO module is independent from one another, and has the same structure.  We model inbound data routes and outbound data routes separately.  This separation of concerns is a key feature of the framework.

```js
bone.io.Module = bone.io('namespace', {

  inbound: {
    middleware: [
      ...
    ],
    route: function(data, context) {
      ...
    }
  },

  outbound: {
    middleware: [
      ...
    ],
    route: function(data, context) {
      ...
    }
  }
});
```

* `Module` - IO modules are attached to `bone.io` as a best practice for easy access.
* `namespace` - Is a unique namespace for the given IO Module and Server/Browser combination.
* `inbound` - Is the configuration for inbound data routes.
* `outbound` - Is the outbound data routes.
* `inbound:middleware` - Is an array of middleware functions executed in series.
* `outbound:middleware` - Is an array of middleware functions executed in series.
* `inbound:[route]` - Inbound data route.
* `outbound:[route]` - Outbound data route.

#### Data Routes

Data routes have the following signature:

```js
  route: function(data, context) {
    ...
  }
```

* `data` - Data coming into or out of the application.
* `context` - Context for understanding what to do with the data.

The `data` variable is the data delivered from either the browser or node.  The `context` gives you contextual information about the data route.  Context might be a session or the view that initiated the route, or anything else that will help us use the data correctly.

Inside a data route there are a few functions automatically assigned to `this`:

* `this.join` - Allows a socket to subscribe to a channel.
* `this.leave` - Allows a socket to unsubscribe to a channel.
* `this.emit` - Emits a message to the socket or channel.
* `this.volatile` - Emits a volatile message to the socket or channel.
* `this(channel)` - Returns the given channel, must be a string.


#### Middleware

Middleware function have the following signature:

```js
function(data, context, next) {
  ...
}
```

* `data` - Data coming into or out of the application.
* `context` - Context for understanding what to do with the data.
* `next` - A callback that must be called at the end.

Middleware can be attached to both inbound routes and outbound routes.  In the next section we'll talk a little about what types of middleware you might setup in node or the browser.


# Router

![bone.io](http://cdn.techpines.io/bone.io-router-architecture.png)

The router in bone.io is very similar to Backbone.js:

```js
bone.Router = bone.router({

    routes: {
        "help":                 "help",    // #help
        "search/:query":        "search",  // #search/bones
        "search/:query/p:page": "search"   // #search/bones/p7
    },

    middleware: [
        bone.router.middleware.session,
        bone.router.middleware.authenticate({
            redirect: '/login'
        })
    ],

    help: function() {
        ...
    },

    search: function(query, page) {
        ...
    }
});
```

The main difference is that the router supports the concept of middleware.  There are two router middleware classes.

* bone.router.middleware.session
* bone.router.middleware.authenticate

# Templates

To set templates for bone.io, you need to do the following:

```js
bone.templates = {
    layout: function() { return '<div id="content"></div><div id="sidebar"></div>'},
    table: function() { return '<table></table>'},
    list: function(data) { return '<ul><li>Bone.io</li><li>'+data+'</ul>'}
};
```

The templating language is up to you, but it must be compiled to javascript functions.

Then for mounting different parts of the page you can use the `mount` command:

```js
bone.mount('body', 'layout');
bone.mount('#content', 'table');
bone.mount('#sidebar', 'list', {data: 'hello', refresh: true});
```

Your mounts should cascade, which is that your highest level DOM nodes need to be mounted first.  In the example above, the `layout` template is attached to the `body` first, before the sub templates.

Typically, you should do this within your routes.  Mounts are not really intended for dynamic data, they are intended to be the static skeleton of a page.

Mounts are based on a single DOM element.  They remove existing DOM elements using jquery `remove` before doing their append.  They also will not render twice by default, this allows you to mount say, your navbar in every route, but then have it not rerender every time a route is called.

## Logging

By default, bone.io will log activity to the console.  Here are the log messages:

```
Inbound:   [eventSpace:action] data         # Data coming into the browser
Outbound:  [eventSpace:action] data         # Data going out of the browser
View:      [selector:action]   data         # DOM manipulation action
Interface: [selector:event]    eventTarget  # DOM events
Route:     [regex:url]                      # URL Route Change
```

_Warning_: You should never run the logger in production, it causes memory leaks.  It is strictly for development purposes.  In production, you need to turn it off:

```js
bone.log = undefined;
```
